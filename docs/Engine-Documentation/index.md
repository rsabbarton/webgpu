## Richard's Alternative GPU Engine (a.k.a. RAGE)

The RAGE Engine will be referred to as "the engine" or just "engine" in the code.  This is primarily because RAGE is not very descriptive and will likely change to something else as it evolves.


## What is The Engine

The Engine is a WebGPU only (check browser support) graphics engine.  It is not for general consumption and is more of a learning exercise in how WebGPU works.  How it differs from WebGL and how new features in the graphics adapters can be harnessed within the web browser.
