# Rage Documentation

### Richard's Awesome Graphics Engine <br> (a.k.a. RAGE)

The RAGE Engine will be referred to as "rage" or "the engine" or just "engine" in the code.  These terms should be considered synonymous.


## What is The Engine

The Engine is a WebGPU only (check browser support) graphics engine.  It is not for general consumption and is more of a learning exercise in how WebGPU works.  How it differs from WebGL and how new features in the graphics adapters can be harnessed within the web browser.
